# tdlib
TDLib or Three's Derma Lib is a derma library created by Threebow allowing you to create beautiful Garry's Mod UI quickly and without hassle. No more messing with paint functions.

### View the documentation [here](https://threebow.gitbooks.io/tdlib/content/) - GitBooks isn't letting me make any more changes to those docs or even use my account, so please keep [this information](https://threebow.gitbooks.io/tdlib/content/updating.html) in mind when you are using classes - it won't work without it! 

## Installation
Move the file into the `lua/autorun/client` of your addon. Do **not** edit the file in case there are multiple copies of it on the server from other addons, to avoid confliction. If you feel a modification is neccesary, open a pull request.
