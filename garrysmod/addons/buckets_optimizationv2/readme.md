# This addon is a V2 of the other Bucket's Optimizations addon in here

# Why make a V2 and not update the V1?
This version contains a bunch of new features and functionality that V1 just didn't offer.

# Commands

**!al** - enables the antilag script temporarily     
**!al 0** - disables the antilag script permanently      
**!al 1** - enables the antilag script permanently     

Everything here is printed in the client's chat and is completely optimized for large server's use.     

This addon has **no** effect on addons inside DarkRP servers or the latter.    

# Why was this not posted on the workshop like the last one?
Good question. My GMPU (gmod publishing tool) decided to kill itself and not work. So I'm leaving the logo inside the file just because I can...I guess.
